Everything here may be quoted or reused in coverage of Vela.

## One sentence

Vela is a free, open-source maps and navigation app for Android that works without Google Play
Services or a Google account.

## One paragraph

Vela is a free, open-source maps and navigation app for Android, built for phones without Google
Play Services. The map and the places on it come from open data such as OpenStreetMap and Overture
Maps. For the things open data does not have, like reviews, opening hours and traffic-aware
routes, the phone looks them up on Google's public website the way a logged-out browser would,
with no account and no API key. Nothing you save leaves the device. It is in beta and maintained
by one developer.

Google sees an IP address and the question. It does not see an account, a device ID or an app key.
One setting, "Use Vela without Google", turns every Google request off, and downloaded regions
work fully offline. Full detail: https://github.com/PimpinPumpkin/Vela/blob/main/PRIVACY.md

## Surveillance cameras

Vela shows mapped license-plate readers (Flock and others) from the community DeFlock project,
and fixed speed cameras from OpenStreetMap. It can warn when one is ahead and can prefer a route
that passes fewer of them when the detour is small. It shows cameras people have mapped; it cannot
know about ones nobody has.
